# Handwritten digit recognition(Kaggle competition)
This project focuses recognizing hand-written digits 
from famous MNIST dataset, using Tensorflow and Keras. 
These were used to implement LeNet-5 CNN architecture.

##Technologies:
- python 3.8
- tensorflow 2.4.0
- keras 2.4.3 


## Performace:
Models accuracy without any parameter tuning or optimization  
on the kaggles test set was 98.367% and placed in the 
top 53%.
